# PCI-DSS IT Security Audit & Compliance Case Study

## Overview
This project documents an IT security and compliance audit conducted for a mock multi-site organization using the PCI-DSS v4.0 framework. The assessment evaluated network architecture, access controls, monitoring practices, and security governance to identify compliance gaps and recommend remediation strategies.

## Scope
- Network segmentation and DMZ architecture
- Firewall and VPN configurations
- Identity and access management controls
- Password and MFA enforcement
- Logging, monitoring, and incident detection
- Vulnerability management and patching
- Security policies and awareness training

## Key Findings
- MFA implemented but not fully operationalized
- Outdated password policies with no review cycle
- No regular penetration testing performed
- Inconsistent patch management practices
- Limited security awareness training
- Policies and incident response plans are not regularly tested

## Recommendations
- Implement continuous monitoring and access reviews
- Enforce least privilege and role-based access controls
- Conduct regular penetration testing and tabletop exercises
- Update and test incident response and recovery plans
- Establish ongoing security awareness training

## Frameworks & Tools
- PCI-DSS v4.0
- NIST SP 800-53 (reference)
- CIS Critical Security Controls
- draw.io (network diagramming)
